# mini-coding-project-revou
Mini coding project from RevoU Software Engineering Fundamental Course

Github page : https://agungardneham.github.io/mini-coding-project-revou/

In this course, I learn about :
- Basic of HTML (element, attribute, semantic, etc)
- Basic of CSS (selector, flexbox, design and color, etc)
- Github and how to connect my coding software to github
- A little bit of javascript (still need to learn this)
- And combining all of that to make a simple travel agent website (in github page)

What I need to improve :
- Navbar
- Script (JS)
- Add animation (animate on scroll?)
- Hero image slider (JS again)
- Media queries
